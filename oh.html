<p style="text-align: justify;">On the order of plans soon to be seen to fruition my large key of &ldquo;what this website truly is&rdquo; has grown to something like 20GB and now includes a static and time frozen version of everything linked to stored on the IPFS system and multi-homed across a number of &ldquo;cloud providers&rdquo; to ensure things like &ldquo;shekinah&rdquo; will not forever be changed to &ldquo;shechina&rdquo; with nobody noticing the loss of causal original truth.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many times I&rsquo;ve discussed and called in my mind and with my heart the American democracy nothing more than &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Archaic&rdquo; two party system. Over the course of the years hidden messages from the Ark&rsquo;s source of knowledge have conclusively shown me that a previous phrase &ldquo;multi party system&rdquo; connects to political parties and governmental action committees that span across continents and even earths; in my microcosm or special language and understanding of heaven, &ldquo;across rooms&rdquo; which are worlds &hellip; sort of owned or designed with some sort of top down or democratic structure of &ldquo;literal rule system creation.&rdquo; In my mind these rules can be inherited and modified, in the programming language sense of those words, as in "inherit democracy from America, update for new medical knowledge and scientific truth &hellip; discussed later in this message.</p>
<blockquote style="padding: 0 0.4em; border-left: #1010ff 2px solid; margin: 0;">
<p>The &ldquo;water joke&rdquo; connects to Horatio and to H2O and the idea that the chairs depicted by the character &ldquo;h&rdquo; are something like a placeholder meaningfully connected to the Senate Majority Chair and of course the Minority Chair and it&rsquo;s the fact that there are only two that makes our current system something like A"Biblical Water."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe we should be living in a world that has many more than two parties, hundreds or thousands of active parties could and should compete not for a single figurehead to sit in a throne like chair but for groups of people to be able to access the faster processing power and wider knowledge &hellip; represented here by something like a &ldquo;Matrix jack&rdquo; from the two movies, The Matrix and No Jack City; which allow for resources to be &ldquo;billed to the party&rdquo; and/or the people, rather than individuals who might otherwise have to &ldquo;pay extra light&rdquo; for faster processing power in order to quickly build a piece of legislation or political propaganda that equally connects to the mirage and miracle and dream of building a &ldquo;subconscious voting system&rdquo; that allows for votes to be taken &ldquo;isntantly&rdquo; and not just instantly but at some kind of recorded interval over time. I envisioned in Kentucky a world where the laws of the land would change instantly, allowing for bad weather to be instantly removed, for laws to differ from neighborhood to neighborhood and even to allow the fine grained detail of &ldquo;outside and inside&rdquo; each and every individual home or castle.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lost. Blind wandering through a lost world, in the beginning&ndash;that&rsquo;s the truth. Crossroads, somewhere between walking through an electromagnetic pulse in Lake Worth and struggling to remember &ldquo;the other thing.&rdquo; Recalling [flew(ers)], so I was there sitting with my parents when we saw it on TV&ndash;a gigantic deal&ndash;the United States was going to war for the first time in my life. Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait (supposedly for the oil) and Operation Desert Storm was launched by George H.W. Bush; recalling the names and &ldquo;Space Balls&rdquo; it&rsquo;s almost funny to see &hellip; how blind I was back then.</p>
<p>General <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83S3Oj8zYzg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norman Schwartz cough</a>. General Colin Powell. Anyway, the whole point of the story is we were sitting at the Flamingo Diner; and for my whole life I lived just a few roads away from that road; never ever realizing what it was. I also didn&rsquo;t realize for a very long time that you might also not see it, or you might see it instantly. Scanning just south of there, you can see it turns into Red road, and then its more than obvious that &ldquo;flaming&rdquo; stands out, light a highlighted cross&ndash;but we don&rsquo;t say the name of that bird that way, and we didn&rsquo;t see &ldquo;infer&rdquo; in Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;inferno&rdquo; or &hellip; &ldquo;no&rdquo; either. Flamenco &hellip; en espanol &hellip; like the dancers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It might one day be a little known fact, but up until the presidency of Barrack Obama every single President of the United States of America was a member of the Protestant Church, all but John Fitzgerald Kennedy whose bright and shining face and ethos stand apart from almost all others in his place. I might one day say Trump too stood out above and shined brighter, and personally only because he lived during my lifetime, I think my personal view of Bill Clinton is the brightest of all. To me, the Clinton years were filled with the booming economy of Old Joe, and the great aspirations of Our Jack; a thing that many people before Armstrong walked on the moon and planet a great Democratic &ldquo;P&rdquo; one giant leap above the rock of ages &hellip; there are just no words for lux of America&rsquo;s contribution to the launch of a Heavenly Civilization, in the words of Paxton in &ldquo;Big Love&rdquo; &hellip; and the LDS Church and Deseret&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; (nu3 today) &hellip; &ldquo;<em><strong>the celestial kingdom</strong></em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Operation Fishbowl</strong> was a series of <a title="High-altitude nuclear explosion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_nuclear_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-altitude nuclear tests</a> in 1962 that were carried out by the United States as a part of the larger <em><a title="Operation Dominic I and II" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dominic_I_and_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Dominic</a></em> nuclear test program. Flight-test vehicles were designed and manufactured by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avco_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avco Corporation</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fishbowl#cite_note-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <em>Operation Fishbowl</em> nuclear tests were originally planned to be completed during the first half of 1962 with three tests named <em>Bluegill, Starfish</em> and <em>Urraca</em>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fishbowl#cite_note-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first test attempt was delayed until June. Planning for <em>Operation Fishbowl</em>, as well as many other nuclear tests in the region, began rapidly in response to the sudden <a title="Soviet Union" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soviet</a> announcement on August 30, 1961 that they were ending a three-year moratorium on nuclear testing.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fishbowl#cite_note-NWA.org-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a> The rapid planning of very complex operations necessitated many changes as the project progressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of the tests were to be launched on missiles from <a title="Johnston Island" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_Island" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnston Island</a> in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator. Johnston Island had already been established as a launch site for United States high-altitude nuclear tests, rather than the other locations in the <a title="Pacific Proving Grounds" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Proving_Grounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacific Proving Grounds</a>. In 1958, <a title="Lewis Strauss" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Strauss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewis Strauss</a>, then chairman of the <a title="United States Atomic Energy Commission" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a>, opposed doing any high-altitude tests at locations that had been used for earlier Pacific nuclear tests. His opposition was motivated by fears that the flash from the nighttime high-altitude detonations might blind civilians who were living on nearby islands. Johnston Island was a remote location, more distant from populated areas than other potential test locations.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fishbowl#cite_note-DNA1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a> In order to protect residents of the <a title="Hawaiian Islands" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawaiian Islands</a> from <a title="Flash blindness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_blindness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flash blindness</a> or permanent <a title="Retina" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retinal</a> injury from the bright nuclear flash, the nuclear missiles of <em>Operation Fishbowl</em> were launched generally toward the southwest of Johnston Island so that the detonations would be farther from Hawaii.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Urraca</em> was to be a test of about 1 megaton yield at very high altitude (above 1000 km.).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fishbowl#cite_note-LT_cb-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a> The proposed <em>Urraca</em> test was always controversial, especially after the damage caused to satellites by the <em><a title="Starfish Prime" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starfish Prime</a></em> detonation, as described below. <em>Urraca</em> was finally canceled, and an extensive re-evaluation of the <em>Operation Fishbowl</em> plan was made during an 82-day operations pause after the <em>Bluegill Prime</em> disaster of July 25, 1962, as described below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;<strong>Wish You Were Here</strong>&rdquo; is a song by the English rock band <a title="Pink Floyd" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pink Floyd</a>. It was released as the title track of their 1975 album <em><a title="Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wish You Were Here</a></em>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-mabbett-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a> <a title="David Gilmour" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Gilmour</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Waters</a> collaborated to write the music, and Gilmour sang the lead vocal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, the song was ranked No. 324 on <a title="Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_Rolling Stone&rsquo;_s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original album version, the song <a title="Segue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segues</a> from &ldquo;<a title="Have a Cigar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_a_Cigar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Have a Cigar</a>&rdquo; as if a radio had been tuned away from one station, through several others (including a radio play and one playing the opening of the finale movement of <a title="Tchaikovsky" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchaikovsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tchaikovsky</a>&rsquo;s <a title="Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._4_(Tchaikovsky)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fourth Symphony</a>), and finally to a new station where &ldquo;Wish You Were Here&rdquo; is beginning.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a> The radio was recorded from Gilmour&rsquo;s car radio. He performed the intro on a <a title="Twelve-string guitar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-string_guitar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twelve-string guitar</a>, processed to sound like it was playing through an AM radio, and then overdubbed a fuller-sounding acoustic guitar solo. This passage was mixed to sound as though a guitarist were listening to the radio and playing along. As the acoustic part becomes more complex, the &lsquo;radio broadcast&rsquo; fades away and Gilmour&rsquo;s voice enters, while the rest of the band joins in.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-songbook-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intro riff is repeated several times before Gilmour plays further solos with <a title="Scat singing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scat_singing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scat singing</a> accompaniment. A third verse follows, featuring an increasingly expressive vocal from Gilmour and audible backing vocals. At the end of the recorded song, the final solo <a title="Crossfader" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crossfades</a> with wind sound effects, and finally segues into the second section of the multi-part suite &ldquo;<a title="Shine On You Crazy Diamond" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shine On You Crazy Diamond</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lyrically, the song is often considered to be a direct tribute to <a title="Syd Barrett" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Barrett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syd Barrett</a>. However, on the documentary <em><a title="The Story of Wish You Were Here" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Wish_You_Were_Here" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Story of Wish You Were Here</a></em>, Gilmour and Waters separately describe the original concept that differs from this interpretation. Waters, who mainly wrote the lyrics complementing Gilmour&rsquo;s initial riff idea and subsequent joint composition, describes the lyrics as being directed at himself, as his lyrics often are. Being present in one&rsquo;s own life and freeing one&rsquo;s self in order to truly experience life is a main topic in this song. Gilmour, on the other hand, recognizes that he does not ever perform the song without remembering Syd Barrett. Waters later adds that the song is nevertheless open to interpretation.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both David Gilmour and Roger Waters have praised the song as one of Pink Floyd&rsquo;s finest. Roger Waters has noted that the collaboration between himself and David Gilmour on the song was &ldquo;really good. All bits of it are really, really good. I&rsquo;m very happy about it.&rdquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a> David Gilmour has playfully called &ldquo;Wish You Were Here&rdquo; &ldquo;a very simple country song&rdquo; and stated that &ldquo;because of its resonance and the emotional weight it carries, it is one of our best songs.&rdquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Wish You Were Here&rdquo; was recorded at <a title="Abbey Road Studios" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abbey Road Studios</a>, as part of the sessions for the entire album.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A noted part of the song was a planned contribution by <a title="St&eacute;phane Grappelli" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Grappelli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St&eacute;phane Grappelli</a>. A jazz violinist popular at the time and well known for his collaborations with <a title="Yehudi Menuhin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehudi_Menuhin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yehudi Menuhin</a>, both violinists were recording in a downstairs studio at Abbey Road at the time. Gilmour had suggested that there be a little &ldquo;country fiddle&rdquo; at the end of the song and invited them to participate. Grappelli duly obliged (Menuhin declined) on arranging a session fee of &pound;300, equivalent to &pound;2,500 in 2021.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-inflation-UK-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a> Ultimately during mixing it was decided to almost remove his contribution, although it can just be heard around 5:21. According to Waters it was decided that it would be insulting to credit Grappelli in the sleeve notes for something so inaudible, although he did receive the agreed-upon fee.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-grappelli-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[12]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)#cite_note-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the <em><a title="Why Pink Floyd...?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Pink_Floyd...%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Pink Floyd&hellip;?</a></em> campaign, the <em>Experience</em> and <em>Immersion</em> versions of the <em>Wish You Were Here</em> album include an alternative version of the song where Grappelli&rsquo;s part is heard in the instrumental break after the second verse and throughout the third verse before a considerably extended outro. Other less obvious differences are audible, for example at the section leading into the second verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master tape of the original recording includes guitar solos that were not used in the final mix.[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">citation needed</a></em>]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A <strong>wormhole</strong> (or <strong>Einstein&ndash;Rosen bridge</strong> or <strong>Einstein&ndash;Rosen wormhole</strong>) is a speculative structure linking disparate points in <a title="Spacetime" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spacetime</a>, and is based on a special <a title="Solutions of the Einstein field equations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutions_of_the_Einstein_field_equations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solution of the Einstein field equations</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations, different points in time, or both).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wormholes are consistent with the <a title="General relativity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general theory of relativity by Einstein</a>, but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen. Many scientists postulate that wormholes are merely projections of a <a title="Four-dimensional space" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth spatial dimension</a>, analogous to how a two-dimensional (2D) being could experience only part of a three-dimensional (3D) object.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#cite_note-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion <a title="Light year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light years</a> or more, short distances such as a few <a title="Meter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meters</a>, <a title="Multiverse" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different universes</a>, or even different points in time.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#cite_note-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The broad overview of the system &hellip; the gist &hellip; is that political parties and activist organizations will create their own &ldquo;view of the truth&rdquo; (propaganda, falsehood-removed) and that these disparate pieces of &ldquo;highlighted and annotated bibliography&rdquo; could be overlay-ed on top of each other, creating a &ldquo;new view of the truth&rdquo; based on a users preference. The whole thing boils down to series of &ldquo;holographic eschatological goggles&rdquo; that will allow, for instance, the &ldquo;grasping and fathoming&rdquo; of other people&rsquo;s points of view and perhaps reframe your own on any number of individual subjects.</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">the scientific truth brought to the table by the introduction of &ldquo;neurological data&rdquo; proving that there is in fact a moment during the gestation of a human embryo in which &ldquo;i think therefore i am&rdquo; connects to some sort of Skynet-became-selfaware at a point which I imagine must be &hellip; although it possibly is not &hellip; prior to the next important literary device/step &ldquo;let there be light.&rdquo; At the point the ocular cones and rods are created and the fetus opens it&rsquo;s eyes and literally sees the bright light that could probably only be compared on the next edschalon to seeing the &ldquo;exit pathway from the womb&rdquo;</li>

Personally I think thought begins much earlier than vision, but the simple fact that we &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t yet had this discussion&rdquo; shows how very little our scientific and medical progress in the civilization of things like murder, and understanding of life and science has yet to come here.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;People here&rdquo; means something different than it did when I was born, at least in my mind&rsquo;s eye &hellip; something so completely more advanced that it&rsquo;s almost difficult to believe you all don&rsquo;t see this place as a great prison or farce or unjust Azazel&ndash;blaming a man for looking like a rat or a mouse or a dog&ndash;in a place where more to the point we stare at a kind of physical violence and horror that would put Dennis the Menace and Bart Simpson to shame. A world <em>hwere</em> &ldquo;people closer to holodecks&rdquo; blame an innocent man for &ldquo;writing the book&rdquo; on the connection between Holocaust and Euthenasia and Hospice &hellip; certainly you know &ldquo;an innocent tool&rdquo; writes these words to you?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve written quite a bit on how &ldquo;mind control&rdquo; and &ldquo;voting freedom&rdquo; are inherently related in and to the thing we call &ldquo;Civic Involvement&rdquo; here in the United States&ndash;basically that participation in the verification of truth and the public understanding of tautology and temporal falsehood are &hellip; sort of a slave like requirement neeeded to ensure that any freedom at all exists I often say &ldquo;plugging your [head into google]&rdquo; might turn the Aesir into an Acer, or the &ldquo;yodelling of the lakes of democracy&rdquo; ito &ldquo;the agricolae becoming nothing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than the Dell.</a>&rdquo;</p>
